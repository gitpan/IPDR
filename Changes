Revision history for Collection-IPDR

Please see the examples directory on how to use the module.

IP ownership has now been resolved. This code is released under
artistic_2 license and any changes made,bugs found, general information
additions should be presented back to the author.

0.16	24/08/2009
	Bug in the Cisco module causing the DOCSIS parser to fail
	Thanks to Rui Dias for providing debug and comms to track it down
0.15	20/07/2009
	IP ownership resolved and now release under the artistic_2 license.
0.14	17/07/2009
	Made DataHandler fork when processing data. The time between
	pass off to external function and keep alive timeout could be
	exceeded, so to prevent stall fork applied.
0.13	16/07/2009
	Added keep alive to after session stop, otherwise IPDR exporter
	reported timeout. Session stop is not a disconnect state, so
	collector needs to send keepalive to maintain an open session.
	Fixed CMcpeIpv4List so at LEAST the first entry in the list is
	shown. Checking for more entries should work however there is
	no data available to be 100%
0.12	12/07/2009
	Changed some of the debug error messages to be more meaningful.
	template_value_definitions needs some work. Getting a clearly defined
	valueset is proving very difficult so more vendors required.
	Added some attributes for TCP extensions, so the data is sent to
	third party servers, if needed.
0.11	03/02/2009
	Fixed a typo to pass correct information to IO::Select
0.10	21/11/2008
	Modified some of the DATA_ACK messaging so large sequence sets
	of data are ACKd correctly. ( in someways a bug previously )
	Added 64bit check upon start up. Important as some users reported
	problems with the data but in fact turned out to be non 64bit
	OS or installations of Perl ( make test anyone? )
0.09	9/11/2008
	Added support for 5.1 series software for Motorola BSR
	Some TCP and packet handling changes cause 0.08 to break
	Added nice connection failure state
0.08	3/11/2008
	DOCSIS 1.1 & 3 supported properly now.
	Multiple flows caused issues with session counting. This is
	now resolved.
	Added additional feature to XDR handler to return the RAW data
	before processing to allow independent debugging.
	Tidied up some memory leak issues
	Started work on an IPDR relay function. This module will connect/get
	IPDR data then allow other clients to connect to it for relay. Useful
	to allow vendors/third parties access to the data but not access to
	the original source due to security.
0.07    16/10/2008
        All module versions brought into line for the distribution
        Makes it easier to maintain one version across the board.
0.06	16/10/2008
	Released into the real world after testing completed
	License out under per unit fee.
0.05	Made client and cisco have the same construct names
0.04	Reworked the XDR handler
0.03	Alpha state mark 2
0.02	Alpha state
0.01    01/09/2007
